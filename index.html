<h3><a href="https://skxm.itch.io/legend-of-zelda-remake-and-custom-level">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a></h3>

<h4>Contributions</h4>
<li>For p1_milestone, I contributed by doing these tasks: health + damage, collectables, locked doors + keys, the cheat key, and the Stalfos.</li>
<li>For p1_alpha, I did a majority of the enemies such as the Keese, Gel, Wallmaster, and Aquamentus. I also did the functional player aesthetic, audio/sounds, and
helped with the authentic enemy + item placement + level progression.</li>
<li>For p1_gold, I came up with the new mechanic and custom level design. I also implemented the hourglass that is used in our custom level.</li>

<h3><a href="https://skxm.itch.io/rolling-depths">Rolling Depths</a></h3>

<h4>Contributions</h4>
<li>For p2_gold_spike, I thought of making a platformer that had to do with the platforms switching between dangerous and not dangerous for the player. I implemented two levels to explore my idea and get feedback on it.</li>
<li>For p2_gold, I used the feedback I got from playtesting to improve on some aspects of my game like the player's movement, and aiming to clear up some confusion with features of the game like the platforms switching color. I implemented everything for this game which includes the player's interactions with the platforms, the movement of the player, the moving platforms, level designs, etc.</li>

<h3><a href="">Kai: Lost Waters</a></h3>

<h4>Contributions</h4>
<li>For p3, I contributed the initial idea of the game having to do with elements. I drew a decent amount of concept art for the character, objects in the game, etc. I helped with designing the levels as well as coming up with puzzle ideas for the game. I implemented the animations for the player character and the fire geckos into the game. Another way I contributed was by finding sound effects and music that would fit our game. I also handled the outreach for the freelancing work that we used for our game and trailer. Throughout the whole process, I participated in all of the team meetings that took place and shared my thoughts and ideas for the game's direction and features. I also was the primary person that set up the JIRA sprints and tasks as well as writing up the DevBlog posts for the last three milestones.</li>
