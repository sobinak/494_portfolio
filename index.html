<h2>Contributions</h2>
For p1_milestone, I contributed by doing these tasks: health + damage, collectables, locked doors + keys, the cheat key, and the Stalfos.
For p1_alpha, I did a majority of the enemies such as the Keese, Gel, Wallmaster, and Aquamentus. I also did the functional player aesthetic, audio/sounds, and
helped with the authentic enemy + item placement + level progression.
For p1_gold, I came up with the new mechanic and custom level design. I also implemented the hourglass that is used in our custom level.
